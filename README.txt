SideQuest1

Description: SideQuest1 is a 2D videogame (a top-down zombie shooter). The goal
of the game is to survive as many waves as you can and get a high score. There
are various weapons around the map that the player can purchase to deal more
damage or replenish their ammo. Zombies will also sometimes drop a health or
ammo bonus so the player should pick these up before they despawn. Every
additional round includes more zombies that have higher stats, every 10 rounds
is a "challenge" round (yikes!).

Usage: Controls are WASD to move, mouse to aim, left click to attack, R to
reload weapon, and E to interact/purchase item.
Some tips follow: knife really helps on early rounds so you can conserve pistol
ammo and get shotgun as soon as possible, reloading takes a fair amount of time
so its a good idea to switch weapons instead if you are getting chased, rifle
has high fire rate and can pierce one enemy but has low damage, shotgun has
very high damage but low fire rate and shots don't pierce.

Compilation: Compile with make, the only project dependencies are OpenGL, GLM,
and SOIL library.

Notes: If you find any bugs or have suggestions I would like to hear them! I
put a lot of work into this project because I've done some similar game
projects in the past but never finished them. I'm really glad this one turned
out differently.

Time: At least 60+ hours. I've been working on this every day since Wednesday
and wishing I had started it earlier.
